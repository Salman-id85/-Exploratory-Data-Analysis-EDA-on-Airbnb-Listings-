# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# 1. Data Collection
Source Dataset: Start by sourcing your dataset from Kaggle, Inside Airbnb, or using an API if available. Make sure the dataset is relevant to the city you're focusing on.
# 2. Data Exploration
Load Dataset: Use libraries like Pandas to load the dataset. You can use pd.read_csv() if your data is in CSV format.
Initial Inspection: Look at the first few rows using df.head(), check data types with df.info(), and get basic statistics with df.describe().
# 3. Data Cleaning
Handle Missing Values: Use methods like df.fillna() or df.dropna() depending on the context.
Remove Duplicates: Identify duplicates with df.duplicated() and remove them using df.drop_duplicates().
Correct Inconsistencies: Standardize categories, fix data entry errors, and ensure consistency across columns.
# 4. Basic Statistics
Average Price: Calculate the average price using df['price'].mean().
Property Types: Use df['property_type'].value_counts() to see the distribution of property types.
Neighborhoods: Similarly, check the distribution of neighborhoods with df['neighborhood'].value_counts().
# 5. Visualization
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Create various plots to visualize the data.
Price Distribution: Use histograms or boxplots.
Room Type Preferences: Bar charts showing counts of different room types.
Listings by Neighborhood: Bar charts or pie charts for neighborhood distribution.
# 6. Geospatial Analysis (Optional)
Maps: If your dataset includes latitude and longitude, you can use libraries like Folium or Plotly to create maps showing listing distributions.
# 7. Time Series Analysis (Optional)
Trend Analysis: If you have date fields, plot trends over time to observe seasonality or other patterns. Use libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for time series plotting.
# 8. Correlation Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Use df.corr() to identify correlations between numerical features.
Scatter Plots: Visualize relationships, such as between the number of bedrooms and price, using scatter plots.
# 9. Data Insights
Summary of Findings: Summarize the key insights from your analysis. Discuss interesting patterns or trends and factors influencing prices and popularity.
# 10. Documentation
Document Findings: Create a detailed report or presentation. Include methodology, visualizations, and insights. Tools like Jupyter Notebooks or a well-organized Markdown file can be helpful.
